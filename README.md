# Daily DSA in C 🚀

This repository is a long-term commitment to build strong problem-solving skills by solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems **daily in C language** and maintaining **consistent GitHub activity**.

The goal is to progress **step by step** from **basic logic to advanced problem-solving**, while following clean coding practices and meaningful commit history.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Build strong **DSA fundamentals** from scratch
- Practice **C programming** aligned with college syllabus
- Maintain **daily GitHub consistency**
- Prepare for **technical interviews**
- Show discipline and growth over time

---

## 🗓️ Timeline

- **Start**: Today (B.Tech – 4th Semester)
- **End Target**: January 2028
- **Duration**: ~2 Years
- **Frequency**: Daily (1–2 programs/day when possible)

---

## 🧠 Learning Path

Problems will follow this difficulty progression:




Each level focuses on improving:
- Logical thinking
- Optimization
- Edge case handling
- Interview readiness

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each program is stored with a **clear, descriptive filename**:



- One main concept per file
- File names explain the problem clearly
- Code is easy to revisit and revise

---

## 🔁 Commit Strategy

Each day includes **multiple meaningful commits** (minimum 4):

1. Basic program structure
2. Core logic implementation
3. Edge case handling
4. Optimization / improvement

Example commit messages:
- `Day 1: basic input and output structure`
- `Day 1: added loop to calculate sum`
- `Day 1: handled negative input`
- `Day 1: optimized using mathematical formula`

This approach shows **real development**, not copy-paste solutions.

## 🛠️ Language & Tools

- **Language**: C
- **Concepts**:
  - Loops
  - Conditionals
  - Functions
  - Arrays
  - Pointers
  - Recursion
  - Data Structures
  - Algorithmic optimization
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## 🎯 Outcome

By the end of this journey:
- Strong command over **DSA**
- Solid **C programming foundation**
- Impressive **GitHub contribution graph**
- Confidence in **technical interviews**
- Proof of long-term consistency and discipline
