# Daily DSA in C 🚀

This repository tracks my **daily DSA journey in C**, starting from fundamentals and progressing step-by-step to advanced problem solving.

## 📅 Day 01
**Problem:** Sum of first N natural numbers  

**Concepts used:**
- Input handling
- Loops
- Mathematical optimization
- Edge case validation

**Goal:**  
Build strong DSA foundations with **daily consistency**, **clean commits**, and **interview-ready code**.

📌 One program per day (sometimes more), committed in **multiple steps** to show real development.
